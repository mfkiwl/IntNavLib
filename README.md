# IntNavLib

This is my integrated navigation c++ playground.
The code is inspired by "Principles of GNSS, Inertial, and Multisensor Integrated Navigation" by Paul Groves.

## TODOs

- Finish unit testing & debugging ECEF inertial navigation

- Integrate GNSS (LC)

- Integrate GNSS (TC)

- Remove dependencies: place eigen in include dir, glog?

## Future development

- Fuse map matching

- Fuse Lidar

- Fuse CVN

- Tight GNSS
